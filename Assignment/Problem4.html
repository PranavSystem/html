        <header><h1>Black Hole</h1></header>
<div >
       <p>
        A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light or other 
        electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently 
        compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. 
        Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable 
        features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no 
        light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with 
        the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the 
        order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.

        Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by 
        John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace. In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found the first modern solution of general 
        relativity that would characterize a black hole. David Finkelstein, in 1958, first published the interpretation of 
        "black hole" as a region of space from which nothing can escape. Black holes were long considered a mathematical 
        curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general 
        relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally 
        collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The first black hole known was Cygnus X-1, 
        identified by several researchers independently in 1971.

        Black holes of stellar mass form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole 
        has formed, it can grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. Supermassive black holes of millions of solar 
        masses (M☉) may form by absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes. There is consensus that 
        supermassive black holes exist in the centres of most galaxies.

        <p>
        The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic 
        radiation such as visible light. Any matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external accretion disk 
        heated by friction, forming quasars, some of the brightest objects in the universe.

                In 1915, Albert Einstein developed his theory of general relativity, having earlier shown that gravity 
                does influence light's motion. Only a few months later, Karl Schwarzschild found a solution to the 
                Einstein field equations that describes the gravitational field of a point mass and a spherical mass. A 
                few months after Schwarzschild, Johannes Droste, a student of Hendrik Lorentz, independently gave the 
                same solution for the point mass and wrote more extensively about its properties. This solution 
                had a peculiar behaviour at what is now called the Schwarzschild radius, where it became singular, 
                meaning that some of the terms in the Einstein equations became infinite. The nature of this surface was
                 not quite understood at the time. In 1924, Arthur Eddington showed that the singularity disappeared after
                  a change of coordinates, although it took until 1933 for Georges Lemaître to realize that this meant the
                   singularity at the Schwarzschild radius was a non-physical coordinate singularity. Arthur Eddington 
                   did however comment on the possibility of a star with mass compressed to the Schwarzschild radius in a 
                   1926 book, noting that Einstein's theory allows us to rule out overly large densities for visible 
                   stars like Betelgeuse because "a star of 250 million km radius could not possibly have so high a 
                   density as the Sun. Firstly, the force of gravitation would be so great that light would be unable to 
                   escape from it, the rays falling back to the star like a stone to the earth. Secondly, the red shift 
                   of the spectral lines would be so great that the spectrum would be shifted out of existence. Thirdly, 
                   the mass would produce so much curvature of the spacetime metric that space would close up around the 
                   star, leaving us outside (i.e., nowhere)."
